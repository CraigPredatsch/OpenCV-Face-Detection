# OpenCV-Face-Detection

This code was written in Python 2 on a Raspberry Pi.
It relies on the operator using a raspberry pi camera.
It will search for a user's face and draw a box around it, then it will search within each face box for eyes and draw boxes around them.

Credit to Carlo Mascellani at http://rpihome.blogspot.com/2015/03/face-detection-with-raspberry-pi.html for his OpenCV with a PiCamera tutorial that I altered to reach my result.
